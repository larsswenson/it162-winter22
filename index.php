 <p>Born and raised in Seattle, I grew up obsessed with music, specifically guitars and records. I'm also interested in travel, photography and cultural history.</p>
 <p>Now in my second quarter at SCC, I'm enrolled in the IT program on an AAS-T track, seeking to transition away from the retail and record store work I'd previously been involved in for so many years.</p>
 <p>I'm looking forward to the new challenges and opportunities my continuing education presents. I hope as I gain more knowledge and experience, specific areas of particular interest or ability will reveal themselves.</p>
